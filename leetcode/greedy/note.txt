Important Points for Greedy(Specially for questions innvolving intervals)

*** For General Questions innvolving Intervals ***
1. For any question that deals with ranges just follow the train model
2. Sort both the arrival times and departure times.
3. Use 2-pointer method to keep a note of both the node to be added and removed with the (pos, end_pos) variables
4. Update them whenever the respective time's are lesser

Complexities:

Space Complexity : O(n)
Time Complexity  : O(nlogn)


*** For Questions dealing with Minimum things in a list of intervals ***

1. Always make sure that the intervals are sorted in the order of the finishing times
2. Because a interval that gets finsihed first wiill give more opportunity to the remaining intervals
3. After that we follow the train-station approach to solve the problem


Complexities:

Space Complexity : O(n)
Time Complexity  : O(nlogn)
