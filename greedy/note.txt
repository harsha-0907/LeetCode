Important Points for Greedy(Specially for questions innvolving intervals)

1. For any question that deals with ranges just follow the train model
2. Sort both the arrival times and departure times.
3. Use 2-pointer method to keep a note of both the node to be added and removed with the (pos, end_pos) variables
4. Update them whenever the respective time's are lesser

Complexities:

Space Complexity : O(n)
Time Complexity  : O(nlogn)
